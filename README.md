# Seeing as you're on my profile...

Why not check out my biggest project to date: https://top.gg/bot/671801771345182782

It's a discord bot designed for easy custom economy and currency systems in your server. It started a year ago (roughly at the start of lockdown 1) and since has grown massively. If you do choose to invite... then thank you for your support! :)
